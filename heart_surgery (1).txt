Heart surgery is a procedure done to correct problems with the heart. The most common type is coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), which improves blood flow to the heart. Other types include valve repair or replacement, and heart transplant. Procedures require anesthesia and are performed by a cardiothoracic surgeon in a sterile environment.
